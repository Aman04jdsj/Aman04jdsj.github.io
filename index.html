	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
			I'm a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Southern California, Viterbi School of Engineering. My areas of interest include Full Stack Development, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.
			During the course of my academic career, I have managed to accrue nearly 19 months of work experience as a software engineer at LogMeIn, AirAsia and dotSolved, where I learned valuable professional skills such as web and mobile platform development, backend programming with APIs, continuous integration and deployment and version control. I have been consistently praised for producing high quality deliverables by my managers and peers. I applied problem-solving, technical and analytical skills when presented with challenges
